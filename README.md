## install

* `git clone https://github.com/a15n/slot-machine.git && cd slot-machine/`
* `npm install && npm run start`


## to see a winner (on roughly every other click)

* uncomment the two lines under `// isWinner helper` in `./src/App.js`
* this is not default behavior and is occasionally buggy
